# battleship
Making a battleship game as part of the Odin Project.

Completed the ship, gameboard and player objects.
Checked all three of them if it is working.
The computer is able to place the ships and also if there is a hit it will target the adjacent cells in the next turn.

Now I have to implement the UI. And then the gameflow.

Designed the gameboard and overall look. Created images for the ships.
Need to implement the placement of ships for the player.

Implemented the placement of player ships.

Next is to implement the gameflow.
