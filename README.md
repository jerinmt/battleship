# battleship
Making a battleship game as part of the Odin Project.

Completed the ship, gameboard and player objects.
Checked all three of them if it is working.
The computer is able to place the ships and also if there is a hit it will target the adjacent cells in the next turn.

Now I have to implement the UI. And then the gameflow.

Designed the gameboard and overall look. Created images for the ships, implemented drag and drop to place the ships in the beginning. 
Need to implement avoiding overlap, out of bounds, and rotation.

Then implement the placement input and start the gameflow.
